_Nix DSL for defining DNS zones_

nix-dns
========

This repository provies:

1. NixOS-style module definitions that describe DNS zones.
2. A DSL to make building DNS zones easier. (Not implemented yet.)

See `test.nix` for an example of a zone. Run `nix-build test.nix` to get this zone written to a file.
